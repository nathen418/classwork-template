## License

- I'm not a legal person so as long as I am credited in a somewhat obvious location, by my name or a link to this repository, I'm ok with it. If my name is not at the top of the file in a comment, it was not written by me and is only in this repo to serve as an example of something I was using for help. If my name does not appear on the file in a comment at the top, then it is not my code, it is class material.  If you have a problem with any of this, refer to my discord server and dm me.
